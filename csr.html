                    <h2>Our CSR Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        At StudySync, we believe that quality education tools shouldn't be a luxury—they should be a fundamental right. Technology has the power to level the playing field, giving every student, regardless of their background or financial situation, access to world-class learning support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy is built on three pillars: Education Accessibility, Environmental Sustainability, and Community Impact. These aren't just buzzwords for us—they're the foundation of every decision we make.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="csr-section">
                    <h2>🌍 Education Accessibility</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Free Forever Plan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unlike many EdTech companies that offer limited "trials" before locking features behind paywalls, StudySync provides a genuinely useful free plan—forever. Our free tier includes deadline tracking, basic PDF summaries, and AI assistance because we believe these foundational tools should be available to everyone.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Scholarships for Students in Need</h3>
                    <p>
                        Starting in Q1 2025, we're launching the StudySync Scholarship Program, providing free Student Pro accounts to students from low-income backgrounds. We've allocated 1,000 scholarships for our first year, with plans to expand based on demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How it works:</strong> Students can apply through a simple form (no essay required). We review applications based on financial need, not academic performance, because everyone deserves access to great tools regardless of their current grades.
                    </p>

                    <h3>University Partnerships in Developing Countries</h3>
                    <p>
                        We're partnering with universities in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa to provide StudySync at heavily subsidized rates (up to 90% discount). Education infrastructure varies dramatically worldwide, and we want to help bridge that gap.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Multi-Language Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        By mid-2025, StudySync will support 15 languages, including Lithuanian, Polish, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Vietnamese. Quality AI tools shouldn't be limited to English speakers.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="csr-section">
                    <h2>🌱 Environmental Sustainability</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Carbon-Neutral Operations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our servers run on 100% renewable energy through partnerships with green data centers. We've calculated our carbon footprint and offset it through verified environmental projects, making StudySync completely carbon-neutral as of November 2024.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Paperless Education Initiative</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every PDF summarized through StudySync represents pages that students don't need to print. We track this impact: since launch, our users have saved an estimated 50,000 pages from being printed—that's roughly 6 trees and 7,500 liters of water.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Optimized AI Models</h3>
                    <p>
                        AI requires significant computational power, which has environmental costs. We're committed to using the most efficient AI models available and continuously optimizing our algorithms to reduce energy consumption without sacrificing quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Our Goal:</strong> Reduce per-user energy consumption by 30% by the end of 2025 through improved model efficiency and infrastructure optimization.
                    </p>

                    <h2>🤝 Community Impact</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Open Educational Resources</h3>
                    <p>
                        We're contributing to the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement by open-sourcing our study guides, templates, and productivity frameworks. Everything we create that doesn't contain proprietary technology is freely available to educators and students worldwide.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Study Skills Workshops</h3>
                    <p>
                        Starting in 2025, we're offering free online workshops on study techniques, time management, and AI literacy. These are open to anyone—you don't need to be a StudySync user. Knowledge should be shared, not gatekept.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Student Mental Health Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        Academic stress is real. We donate 2% of our profits to student mental health organizations and integrate stress management reminders into our app. Our "Study Break" feature actively encourages healthy habits and recognizes burnout patterns.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Local Community Engagement</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a Lithuania-based company, we're committed to our local community. We mentor computer science students at VMU, sponsor local EdTech events, and provide free StudySync accounts to all students at our partner universities in Kaunas.

                    <p>
                        We believe in radical transparency about our social impact. Starting in 2025, we'll publish an annual CSR report detailing:

                    <p>
                        We'll also share what we got wrong and what we're working to improve. Perfection is impossible, but progress through honesty is achievable.
